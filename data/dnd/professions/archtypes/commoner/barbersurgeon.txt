BARBER SURGEON
No one is more important to the health of a small town or
the soldiers' camp than a solid, experienced Barber Surgeon.
Trained in the razor - both to groom the flea-ridden heads
of travelers and to perform base acts of healing - they are
the medical care that the poor and the burgeoning middle
classes can hope for, or expect. 'They shave, cut and groom
the people during the best of times, while they cut, sew
and stitch the wounded in the worst of times. Treatment of
bunions, toothaches and the like fill the times in between.
