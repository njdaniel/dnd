SLAYER
There are things in the dark that mean ill to all, but there are
a few who dedicate their lives to hunting such things. 'Taking
up the mantle of Slayer never comes about under joyous
up the
circumstances. It always begins in blood, a mind-shattering
experience that leaves the Slayer in pain and on a path that
invariably ends in their bloody demise. Each Slayer vows to
aid all those who need monsters slain. The best survive great
battles unseen and unsung, their offers of aid seen as a means
to scare or exhort the peasantry out of ale and coin. There is
no such thing as a bad Slayer; should one make even a single
mistake, then they will probably end up as another skull
littering the bloody lairs of the things that still stalk the night.
The path of the Slayer takes them into dark corners where
they often discover the naked and ugly truths of the world.
They know the sins that birthed monstrous creatures that
lurk; have seen the shadowed undead on the periphery of
reality; and faced demonic hordes in mortal combat. Few
escape such encounters unscathed, mentally or physically,
only for the Slayer to search out the deadly after deadly
encounters until sweet death takes their last breath. This
path can also lead a Slayer's comrades to their doom, for the
Slayer possesses a death wish that can only be fulfilled by a
vainglorious death!
