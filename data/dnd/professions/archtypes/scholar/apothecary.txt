APOTHECARY
whilst the Barber Surgcon seeks to cure the ailing, it is
the Apothecary who brews the medicine. Distilled from
natural (and sometimes unnatural) elements acquired by
old Believers, Apothecaries apply their knowledge to create
a multitude of archaic remedics. These medicines treat
infections with solutions of wine, ward away miasmas and
unhealthy fogs' with pastes and reduce pain originating from
venereal disease and even a skinned knee with the application
of simple unguents. Indeed, the Apothecary is seen as every
bit important as the village Barber Surgeon, but with a
license to brew. Whether any of these potions work is much
debated, as more than a few have died from too many doses
or succumbed to crippling addiction. Most Apothecaries
simply shrug and call it the will of nature, returning to their
pestles and flasks to fulfill the demand for their treatments.
Often, ingredients will be too risky for others to gather, so
Apothecaries must pick up their flasks and set out in search
of their reagents. Of course, not every Apothecary is a
humanitarian. Some do so purely for profit, taking advantage
of good-natured people with quackery. Others create illegal
opiates for consumption by those who can afford it, working
with criminal syndicates to dispense their drugs. But never
double-cross or underpay an Apothecary, as academic1ans
roundly agree that there's a thin line between medicine and
poison. Any sort of medicine taken in large enough doses can
be made into concentrated death... quite a few enterprisig
rich widows have made use of the Apothecary's knowlea8
in this fashion.
