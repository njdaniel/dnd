DIABOLIST
Although Magick permeates the world, most see its wielders
as dangerous and evil, and as heretics to be strung up or
burned at the stake. To hide from the superstition rampant
in a grim & perilous world, its practitionerS are forced to
societys periphery where they can study in secret. Here such
Diabolists become open conduits between the Materiat
Realm and the AEther, as they attempt to reshape the raw stuff
of chaos into orderly, mathematical conclusions. Whether
it is the transmutation of lead into gold, bringing down
lightning from the sky, or conjuring forth grand illusions,
the Diabolist seeks to understand, classify and practice the
art of Magick. These erudite autodidacts guard their studies
well, and whilst some remain loners, many band together in
'colleges'. Overtime they grow into schools of Magick where
this grand tradition is shared with other arcanists.
However, as Diabolists draw forth from the Æther,catastrophe
is never tar away. Simply intoning the wrong consonant or
reading aloud the words in the wrong order (such as in the
case of the infamous invocation of klaatu barada nikto... or
was it necktie?), will allow the Æther to seep forth into the
Material Realm, corrupting the Diabolist first and then the
world around them. Raw chaos can corrupt even the most
steely-minded arcanist, driving them towards madness and
mutation. However, these terrifying moments of unbridled
power are what ultimately make would-be arcanists desire
greater understanding - even if it costs them their very soul.
