ENGINEER
Soaring towers, Hying buttresses, quaint storefronts and
deep mines; all of them had to be built and the Engineer
has a hand in their construction. Engineers are the builders
of the modern age, experienced in all types of construction
and materials. While some stick to the classic materials of
stone and wood, others push the boundaries of technology,
using steel and even strange steam-run machines. Besides
building structures, Engineers also serve in most standing
armies. Whether constructing siege towers, repairing
cannons or packing gunpowder into enemy fortihcations,
Engineers are terrors on the modern battlefield. Dedicated
and intelligent, able to calculate trajectories and angles with
a mere glance, Engineers are also secretive. They know the
strengths of their structures and inventions as well as their
weakneses; knowledge of both might be catastrophic- or
lucrative - if revealed.
