BURGLAR
There's no better bargain to made than the one that costs
strings,
nothing. From shaving coins to cutting purse strings,
Burglars are well-practiced masters in the fine art of getting
something for nothing. No mere thug or ruffian, they are true
professionals who procure what they need with their mark
being none the wiser until it is too late. Many Burglars are
simple cutpurses; some embrace the risks of breaking and
entering; and others engage in plain robbery at knifepoint. No
one respects a Burglar, and in return, the Burglar respects no
one. To them, everything and everyone is a potential target; the
world a fat oyster waiting to be opened, pawned and thrown
away. Burglars are always looking for the next big score,
dreaming of the mythical mark that will set them up for life.
The Burglar is ingenious, able to find opportunity anywhere.
However large their dreams, a Burglar quickly learns that
their success is tied to their contacts. There may be honor
amongst thieves, but friendship in the underworld is often
fickle. Still, anything is better than being caught. A five-
finger discount will often cost a whole hand - if they're lucky.
But when lives are on the line, who better to disarm a trap
or filch a rare jewel than a professional thief? Burglars who
adventure often find riches beyond anything they could steal
in town, but if a petty noble would merely spit on a Burglar
or execute them, imagine what the hordes of darkness might
do? When a demon demands the return of its treasure, the
Burglar's inclination for refusal may cost them their soul.
