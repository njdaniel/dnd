TRAPPER
In a grim & perilous world's colder climes, a good fur-lined
coat could be all that separates you from life and death.
The Trapper is a fur and pelt hunter, but instead of using
guns or blades that could potentially ruin a good fur, they
use traps and then dispatch their quarry with a cut across
the jugular. Most Trappers make their living off of killing
'necessary game; wolf or bear pelts for the cold, seal pelts
for waterproofing and so on. Some trade in the luxury
furs, such as mink or fox normally reserved for the elite.
The most fearless trappers have their eyes on dangerous or
illegal game, like the lions of the south or great basilisks
and their diamond-hard scales. Despite being a necessity to
many, some Trappers are subject to the ire of other rangers
and nature types, accused of exploiting, rather than serving,
the natural world.
Trappers travel far and wide for their quarry, following
migration patterns or delving into lost ruins or caves to find
rarer game. Others are run off of lands, either by territorial
animals who have sensed a threat or a Gamekeeper who
has had too many animals killed. Trapper are adept at not
only making and laying traps, but spotting and disarming
them too, from simple snares to complex arrow traps. They
also possess great survival instincts and are excellent guides,
but the stress of adventuring is entirely different from
that gained from hiding in a tree waiting for your mark to
approach. When a Trapper sees humans flayed or eaten alive
by fodderlings, or see their allies succumb to injury from
traps, they may slowly realize that they are no different from
the monsters they fight.
