ANIMAL TAMER
Whether they be wranglers, rustlers or even sellers of
horseflesh, Animal Tamers tend to live solitary lives with
those creatures they handle. Brusque at times, even boorish,
they typically carry the stench of the pen, replete with
dung between their cleats and straw matted within their
hide leggings. The lowliest train pigeons, ferrets and cats.
Middling Animal Tamers breed hunting raptors and war
dogs. Rarest are the ones who break, dominate and train
bears or other foreign beasts raised in captivity. Some are
even capable of taming the dangerous komodo raptors of the
south or the mysterious rocs flown by certain elves; by far
the most dangerous animals to tame, if they can be properly
tamed at all.
The smallfolk have a particular fondness for the bear-baiter,
as these Animal Tamers act as ringmaster of a menagerie
or carnival. Employing brightly-colored clothing and large
mustachios, they are well-paid to command shambling
bears, thundering elephants and other twisted, foreign
chimera to perform stupid tricks that only simple folk would
be entertained by. Of course the crowd wishes to see these
dangerous creatures pertorm, but also secretly yearns to see
master of ceremonies torn to shreds, stomped into a pulpy
mess or swallowed whole by the very creatures they command!
