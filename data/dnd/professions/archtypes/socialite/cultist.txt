CULTIST
In today's grim & perilous world, it should be no surprise
that there are aristocrats, burghers and the learned who seek
power beyond their ossified positions in society. Perhaps they
joined a fraternal club at university, found a musty tome in
the family library, followed family tradition, listened to the
folklore of old, or were simply bored. Inducted into dark
societies, they practice rites of ages past, use sex Magick,
make strange sacrifices, and aPpease forgotten or banned
gods, all with one aim to make the darkness kneel bcfore
them. And over time, they can learn to command a sliver
of the same divine 'grace as worshipers of state-sanctioned
religions and employ the darkest of Magicks for their own
benefit -power both temporal and material.
Every Cultist knows they run the risk of losing their very soul
in exchange for power. Such a yearning is never easy, it must
be practiced in secret, lest they risk persecution. It explains
why so many band together in secret clubs to practice their
faith together - safety in numbers. Their desire for dark
knowledge means that some also take up the adventuring
life, because adventurers are more likely to uncover baleful
knowledge and artifacts than anyone else. Of course,
this knowledge claws at the minds of the impressionable
and many become raving lunatics locked away in distant
sanitariums where they converse with the voice of the Abyss.
