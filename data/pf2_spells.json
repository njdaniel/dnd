Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together appear together)."

If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type.",

It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 30 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means).

The object can't be used to attack or cause damage when it returns to normal size. If there isn't room for the object to return to normal size when the spell ends, the spell's duration continues until the object is in a location large enough to accommodate its normal size."
