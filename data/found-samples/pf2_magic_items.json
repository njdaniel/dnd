      "This ammunition gains the effects of the ghost touch property and can fly through any obstacle except those that can block incorporeal creatures or effects. You still must have sensed your target (or be able to see it with x-ray vision or a similar ability) in order to target it. Though the ammunition penetrates barriers and ignores cover, the target still benefits from the flat check from being concealed or sensed and the attack is against AC, not TAC.",
      "After it is fired, the ammunition vanishes into mist. However, in the dead of the night 1d4 days later, it reappears in the last quiver or other container it was taken from. Ghost ammunition can be only a basic piece of ammunition; it can never be ammunition made of a special material or with any other special traits or qualities."
