# dnd 

This is helper tool for a players and DMs to help with flow of the sessions. 

Currently this uses the rules of my current 
[homebrew](https://github.com/njdaniel/dnd/wiki) rules. The spirit of the game is the simular but with a more focus on actually 
playing the game and getting emerged into the characters and the story without worrying about the rules except of the DM. 
The DM oversees the game and enforces the laws of the games physics. Character sheets have two versions the PC and DM. 
The PC version has the description of the character their motivation, personality, items, past history, knowledge, and 
overall skills. The DM version has the math and and details for help running the game.
